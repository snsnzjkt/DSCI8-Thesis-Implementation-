EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
====================
This analysis compares the proposed SCS-ID (Squeezed ConvSeek for Intrusion
Detection) model against Ayeni et al.'s baseline CNN model across two main
hypotheses: computational efficiency improvements and detection performance
differences in campus network environments.

   • Statistical Significance: 2/3 metrics significant
   • Conclusion: SUPPORTED

2. DETECTION PERFORMANCE (Hypothesis 2):
   • Overall F1-Score: Baseline 0.4743 vs SCS-ID 0.5317
   • Overall Accuracy: Baseline 0.8871 vs SCS-ID 0.9118
   • False Positive Rate: Baseline 0.0081 vs SCS-ID 0.0063
   • Per-Attack Significance: 20/60 tests significant
   • Conclusion: SUPPORTED

RECOMMENDATIONS:
-----------------
1. COMPUTATIONAL EFFICIENCY: The SCS-ID model is recommended for
   deployment in resource-constrained campus environments due to
   significant improvements in computational efficiency.

2. DETECTION PERFORMANCE: The SCS-ID model shows sufficient
   performance differences to warrant consideration for deployment
   in campus network intrusion detection systems.

LIMITATIONS:
-------------
• Analysis based on CIC-IDS2017 dataset specific to campus networks
• Bootstrap sampling used to generate statistical comparisons
• Results may not generalize to other network environments
• Model performance may vary with different hyperparameter settings

FUTURE WORK:
-------------
• Validation on additional campus network datasets
• Real-time deployment testing in actual campus environments
• Cross-validation with other intrusion detection datasets
• Investigation of model interpretability and explainability
